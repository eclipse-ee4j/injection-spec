== Specification Scope

Jakarta Dependency Injection defines how Jakarta based applications can obtain objects in such a way as to maximize reusability,
 testability and maintainability compared to traditional approaches such as constructors, factories, and service
 locators (e.g., JNDI). This process, known as _dependency injection_, is beneficial to most nontrivial applications.
